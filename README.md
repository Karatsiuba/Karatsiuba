I’m a curious and creative data analyst who loves turning messy data into clear stories 📊. Whether it’s business metrics or everyday patterns — I enjoy finding the “why” behind the numbers 🤔. If I start analyzing trends in my coffee consumption ☕📈 – it's just a regular Monday. Passionate about insights, patterns, and making sense of the chaos 💡.
